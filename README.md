# Toco
Toco is a new programming language that I am making. It is (or will be) a general-purpose, statically typed, compiled language that is fast but has clean and simple code.

## Installation
Make sure LLVM and cmake are installed, then clone this repo and run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
```
